# Enigma4
## Onion Routing App.

Enigma4 implements Onion Routing Protocol, which facilitate secure, end-to-end encrypted communications across the Internet. Before sending over the network, the client must apply several layers of encryption using the keys negotiated during the handshake. Then, before passing to the next one, every server that receives the message removes one layer of encryption using its own key.
